Perfect — here’s a **roadmap to unify LitRPG Studio** into a single cohesive platform, organized by **Immediate → Short-Term → Long-Term** priorities:

---

# 📌 **Phase 1 – Immediate (Foundational Fixes)**

These directly address the “35 random tools” feeling by eliminating fragmentation.

1. **Unified Entity Registry (Single Source of Truth)**

   * Centralize characters, items, skills, locations, events in one registry.
   * Make every tool reference this.
   * 🚨 Highest priority — prevents inconsistencies from multiplying.

2. **Unified Timeline System**

   * Merge all timeline variants into a single, layered timeline.
   * Characters, world events, arcs, and series continuity all sync here.
   * Provides the backbone for story structure.

3. **Modular but Thematic UI**

   * Apply consistent UI language across all modules.
   * Group tools into clear categories:

     * Story Tools (writing, timeline, characters)
     * System Tools (combat, loot, items, skills)
     * Productivity Tools (analytics, focus, templates)
   * Makes the platform “feel” like one product.

---

# 📌 **Phase 2 – Short-Term (Integration & Workflow)**

These make the tools actively feel connected in practice.

4. **Context-Aware Writing Environment**

   * Add sidebar in the editor showing relevant characters, events, items, etc.
   * Inline prompts to prevent continuity errors.
   * Makes the writing process the center hub.

5. **Global Search & Cross-Linking**

   * Search bar that pulls up anything (characters, items, locations, skills).
   * Enable quick linking in text (like Notion’s `@` reference).
   * Strengthens cohesion across modules.

6. **Customizable Dashboard (Author’s Control Center)**

   * Drag-and-drop widgets (word count, timeline, character arcs, world state).
   * Personalized "mission control" view.
   * The first screen feels like a professional studio, not just a menu.

---

# 📌 **Phase 3 – Long-Term (Professional & Advanced)**

These add polish and make LitRPG Studio feel like a premium, indispensable tool.

7. **Consistency Validation Engine**

   * Automated logic checks:

     * Character continuity in timeline
     * Skill prereqs vs progression
     * Item rarity vs loot tables
   * Builds trust in the platform as a “guardian of canon.”

8. **Smart Export Pipeline**

   * Unified export across all tools (drafts, system bibles, series bibles).
   * Support customizable templates for different use cases.

9. **Series & Project Layer**

   * Treat everything as part of a project or series.
   * Tools adapt depending on project type (single novel, multi-book series, game system).

10. **Workflow Mode Switching**

* Toggle between:

  * **Writing Mode** → Editor + timeline + character sidebar
  * **Worldbuilding Mode** → Map, societies, culture tools
  * **System Design Mode** → Skills, combat, loot, progression
* Reduces clutter, reinforces the idea of LitRPG Studio as a unified creative environment.

✅ **Summary of Roadmap:**

* **Phase 1 (Now):** Solve fragmentation (registry, timeline, UI).
* **Phase 2 (Next):** Create integration (context writing, global search, dashboard).
* **Phase 3 (Later):** Add polish & professional workflows (consistency checks, exports, series/project layer, modes).
