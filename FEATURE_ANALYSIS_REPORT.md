## State Management Analysis

### Store Dependencies Map
```
storyStore (Central Hub)
├── characterStore (Character data)
├── worldStateStore (World consistency)
├── analyticsStore (Performance tracking)
└── seriesStore (Multi-book management)
```

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Centralized Story Data**: `storyStore` serves as primary data hub
2. **Cross-Store Communication**: Components often need data from multiple stores
3. **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes propagate across related stores
4. **Persistence Layer**: All stores use Zustand persistence
